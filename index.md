## Overview

[Keter](https://youtu.be/6LJhP7LedU0 ) redefines BPM innovation with tools and methodologies from IBM Cloud Labs. It is a single all-in-one web application for both BPM process development team and testing team.

### Development Team


Developers can easily define or schedule a pipeline. It provides a build-in continuous integration and deployment pipeline that contains testing, checkstyle, snapshot taking and deployment. 

Developers can monitor the building status and overall report through the pipeline dashboard.  If there is any error with the build, they will be notified by mail. 

Developers can perform static analysis on the BPM application, which enforces design convention and processes development standard.There are 80+ checkstyle rules are already defined based on BPM development best practices and anti-patterns . They can find the modification advises for each BPM application artifact. It helps them to improve the coding quality continually. 

1. As a Developer, I want to create unit test cases against the services and coach UI, so that I can run the test cases in CI server to ensure the code quality.
2. As a Deployer, I want to do automatic smoke testing, so that can validate all deployment and configuration are successful.
3. As a Developer, I want to extend the auto testing tool functionalities using customized commands, so that I reduce the testing effort and improve the test coverage.
4. As a Developer, I want to analyze my BPM project with the static analysis tool regularly, so that I can enforce the coding standard and best practice in my project and ensure the quality of the deliverables.
5. As an Architect, I want to be able to customize the code quality rules, so that Banorte's specific policies can be applied.
6. As a Deployer, I want to put the code analysis step in the deployment pipeline, so that I can control the code quality in my deployment cycle.
7. As a Developer, I want to analyze the code quality of a specific snapshot, so that I can control the code quality of all snapshots in my deployment cycle.
8. As a Developer, I want to get the code analysis result organized by categories, so that I understand and assign code quality issues to the Dev team.
9. As a Developer, I want to get the code analysis result with suggestions, so that I know how to solve every issue.

### Testing Team

Tester can automate their test scenarios and boost their productivity easily. They can generate the test project and case template from BPM server, then edit and record their test scenarios without coding. They can use 60+ built-in automation test commands to support BPM application test.

Tester can create a monitor to monitor BPM service metric with alerts. It can send alert message through email for the issue service.

Keter offers detailed reports including screenshots, execution process flow and coverage to improve communications between testers and developers on every test case. 

1. As a Tester, I want to easily create functional test cases, so that the regressive test can be automatically performed against each new version of the BPM project.
2. As a Tester, I want to have comprehensive testing reports, so that we could know the testing coverage of my BPM test project and troubleshooting if any test failed.
3. As a Tester, I want to do automatic regression testing in my DevOps sprint, so that let me to be focused in the new application features.
4. As a Tester, I want a have an auto testing tool that allows me to do End-to-end auto testing without human involved, so I can build a complete test coverage.
5. As a Tester, I want that the auto testing tool can autogenerate the test evidence of every test case, so that I can reduce effort to do it manually.
6. As a Tester, I want that the auto testing tool can run test projects in parallel, so that I can reduce the testing time.
7. As a Tester, I want that the auto testing tool can execute tests in BPM and in other web applications together, so that I can reduce the testing effort. 
8. As a Tester, I want that the auto testing tool is easy to learn and easy to use, so I can reduce my learning time and testing effort.
9. As a Tester, I want to record a test script in one environment and run in different environments, so I can reduce my testing effort.
10. As a Tester, I want to run a test script with multiple test data, so I can reduce my testing effort, make test cases reusable and increase the test coverage.

### Ops Team:
1. As a BPM Administrator, I want to be notified upon the status change or abnormal execution time of specific services, so that I can be take immediate actions on any outrage.
2. As a BPM Administrator, I want to manipulate the in-flight instances more efficiently, so that I do the run-time deggub to fix the issue reported by business users easily. 


### CICD Pipeline
1. As a Deployer, I want to construct an automatic release process, so that I can deliver the BPM releases more frequently and in good quality.
2. As a  Scrum Master, I want to review the build history of my BPM project, so that I can push the team to handle the outstanding issues during development and deployment.
3. As a Developer, I want to deploy my BPM application in TEST env through creating a snapshot or one-click, so that it is available for testing. 
4. As a Deployer, I want to be notified when a deployment is finished, so that I take action when the deployment fails.
5. As a Deployer, I want to able to schedule pipelines to execute, so that I can assure that deployment be executed without human involved.

### Code Review
1. As a developer, I want to compare the different versions of the BPM project, so that I can understand what changes are to be delivered,  what changes are causing issues.
