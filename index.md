### Development Team


Developers can easily define or schedule a pipeline. It provides a build-in continuous integration and deployment pipeline that contains testing, checkstyle, snapshot taking and deployment. 

Developers can monitor the building status and overall report through the pipeline dashboard.  If there is any error with the build, they will be notified by mail. 

Developers can perform static analysis on the BPM application, which enforces design convention and processes development standard.There are 80+ checkstyle rules are already defined based on BPM development best practices and anti-patterns . They can find the modification advises for each BPM application artifact. It helps them to improve the coding quality continually. 


### Testing Team

Tester can automate their test scenarios and boost their productivity easily. They can generate the test project and case template from BPM server, then edit and record their test scenarios without coding. They can use 60+ built-in automation test commands to support BPM application test.
